### Pitch:

**JetSet AI** is an intelligent travel assistant designed to help users explore the best travel destinations. When users provide a country or state, the AI recommends top attractions, provides information about ticket requirements, and suggests the best modes of transportation to reach these destinations. Additionally, it offers hotel recommendations tailored to the user’s preferences, including ratings and budget. The system also tracks the number of available hotels for each rating category.

JetSet AI goes beyond simple recommendations by acting as a personalized trip planner. Upon request, it schedules the trip, suggesting places to visit each day based on factors such as the number of travelers, including elders and children. The AI provides concise responses, ready to answer more detailed questions as needed.

# JetSet AI - Travel Assistant

JetSet AI is an intelligent travel assistant designed to guide users in exploring top travel destinations, booking tickets, and finding accommodation tailored to their preferences. The AI helps users plan their trips efficiently, making travel planning easier and more enjoyable.

## Features

- **Best Places to Visit**: Provides a list of top tourist spots based on the selected country or state.
- **Ticket Information**: Offers details on whether specific attractions require tickets, including ticket pricing.
- **Travel Suggestions**: Recommends the best modes of transport to reach destinations.
- **Hotel Recommendations**: Suggests hotels based on user-defined preferences like budget and ratings.
- **Trip Scheduler**: Plans a detailed itinerary for the user, including daily visit schedules based on the number of people, elders, and children in the group.
- **Concise Answers**: Provides short, precise answers with the option for users to ask more detailed questions.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters the country or state they wish to explore.
2. **Recommendations**: The AI analyzes the input and generates a list of the best places to visit, including ticket information and travel options.
3. **Accommodation**: Based on the user’s budget and preferences, the AI suggests hotels and provides details on the number of available options.
4. **Trip Scheduling**: If requested, the AI organizes the user's trip, including daily schedules of places to visit, taking into account the number of people and any special needs (elders or children).
5. **Interactive Conversations**: The AI asks brief questions when necessary to refine recommendations and offer a more personalized experience.

## Technologies Used

- **AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used for understanding user input and providing meaningful responses.
- **Data Integration**: Pulls real-time data for places to visit, ticketing, transportation options, and hotels from APIs or datasets.
- **Backend Services**: A robust backend system (e.g., Flask or Node.js) that processes data and communicates with external services.
- **Frontend Interface**: User-friendly UI to interact with JetSet AI, built with modern web technologies (React, Vue.js, etc.).

## Steps Followed in the Project

1. **Idea and Conceptualization**: Identified the core needs of travelers and the types of information they require to plan their trips efficiently.
2. **Data Collection**: Gathered datasets or integrated with APIs for attractions, ticketing information, transport, and accommodation.
3. **Designing AI Workflow**: Built the decision-making logic to suggest places, transport, and hotels based on user input and preferences.
4. **Trip Planning Algorithm**: Developed an algorithm to intelligently plan daily trip itineraries based on user preferences.
5. **Development of Frontend and Backend**: Implemented a frontend interface for user interaction and a backend to process requests and fetch data.
6. **Testing and Refinement**: Tested the AI for accuracy, user experience, and efficiency, making improvements based on feedback.

## Future Improvements

- Integrating more advanced AI to suggest custom itineraries based on user preferences and real-time events.
- Adding support for booking tickets and hotels directly through the AI.
- Expanding the scope to support additional languages and more destinations worldwide.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
